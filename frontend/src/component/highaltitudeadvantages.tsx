            <strong>Natural Cooling:</strong> The high-Altitude location
            provides year-round natural cooling, eliminating the need for
            energy-intensive HVAC systems, thereby reducing operational costs.
          </p>

            <strong>Reduced Power Costs:</strong> With minimal electricity
            required for cooling, Everest Peak Data Centre significantly lowers
            power consumption and operational expenses.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>Sustainability:</strong> By prioritizing renewable energy
            sources, including solar and hydroelectric power, the facility
            minimizes its environmental footprint and aligns with global
            sustainability goals.
