          Everest Peak Intelligent Computing aims to leverage Nepalâ€™s
          high-altitude landscapes for innovative, sustainable high-performance
          computing (HPC). Located at Everest View Point in Solukhumbu, at an
          elevation of 3,200 meters, this facility is optimized for providing
          cost-effective computing power without the high electricity costs
          typical of traditional data centers. By harnessing natural cooling and
          renewable energy sources, Everest Peak Data Centre offers an
          energy-efficient solution tailored for artificial intelligence (AI)
          and machine learning (ML) applications.
